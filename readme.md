# Parsa Jekyll

Jekyll Parsa Creative Blog Template ported from [Parsa HTML Template](https://themefisher.com/products/parsa)

## Setup

To start your project, fork this repository
After forking the repo, your site will be live immediately on your personal
Github Pages account, e.g. `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`.

Make sure GitHub Pages is enabled for your repo. It might take some time
for the site to propagate entirely.

## Customize

Things you can customize in the site config file `_config.yml` (no HTML/CSS):

- Theme General Settings ( name, logo, email, phone, address )
- Hero Section
- About Section
- Team Section
- Skills Section
- Exprerience Section
- Education Section
- Services Section
- Portfolio Section
- Testimonials Section
- Client Slider Section
- Contact Section

## Deployment

To run the theme locally, navigate to the theme directory and run
`bundle install` to install the dependencies, then run `jekyll serve` or
`bundle exec jekyll serve` to start the Jekyll server.
I would recommend checking the
[Deployment Methods](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/deployment-methods/)
page on Jekyll website.
